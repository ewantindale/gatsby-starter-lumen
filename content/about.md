Hi, I'm Ewan.

I am a (mostly) self-taught programmer. I've been building things like games and websites since I was a teenager.

I created the ecommerce website for my parents' online business, enabling them to make a full time living doing what they love.

As a freelancer, I've worked with clients all over the world to improve their websites and received glowing reviews.

I've also custom built all of my PCs over the last ~15 years, grown a significant following on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ewanhc/) and competed as a [professional esports player](https://youtu.be/QbbKQkNfvjI).

## Reviews from some of my freelancing clients

- “Ewan was articulate, friendly and provided excellent service. He worked incredibly fast to deliver my project (ninja fast actually!). I'm extremely happy and pleased with his work. I'm also happy to hire Ewan again.”

- “Professional and fast! Really enjoyed working with this seller.”

- “Excellent experience, would do this again for sure. Thank you!”
