Hi, I'm Ewan.

I am a (mostly) self-taught programmer. I've been building things like games and websites since I was a teenager.

I created the ecommerce website for my parents' online business, enabling them to make a full time living doing what they love.

As a freelancer, I've worked with clients all over the world to improve their websites and received glowing reviews.

I've also custom built all of my PCs over the last ~10 years, grown a significant following on Twitch and competed as a professional esports player.
